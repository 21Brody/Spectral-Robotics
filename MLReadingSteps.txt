SpectralDataFormat.py: divides by clear, manually for each one.

CalibrateSensor.cpp: Loads + Averages + Normalizes (white reference). 

Steps: Use SpectralDataFormat to create and run SpectralDataFormatML, then run and create CalibrateSensorML.

SpectralDataFormatML will be the same as SpectralDataFormat just with different files to store the data. CalibrateSensorML will have to be changed so that it averages multiple times.
